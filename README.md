# Welcome to my GitHub Repository - Statistical Testing Playground ðŸ“Š


## Introduction

Welcome to my Statistical Testing Playground! In this repository, you'll find a collection of resources and code examples related to various statistical tests. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or just someone curious about the world of statistics, you've come to the right place.

## Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is the foundation of statistical inference. It allows us to make conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Whether you want to determine if a new drug is effective, if there's a difference between two groups, or if a marketing campaign had an impact, hypothesis testing is your go-to tool.

## t-Test

The t-test is a powerful statistical test used to compare the means of two groups and assess whether the differences between them are statistically significant. It's commonly used in A/B testing, medical research, and much more.

## z-Test

The z-test is another test for comparing means, but it's especially handy when you have a large sample size. It's often used in quality control and manufacturing settings.

## Chi-Square (Ï‡Â²) Test

The Chi-Square test is your go-to test for analyzing categorical data. It helps you determine if there's an association between two categorical variables and is widely used in survey analysis, genetics, and social sciences.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA is a powerful statistical technique for comparing means of more than two groups. It's essential when you're dealing with multiple factors or groups in your analysis.

## K-Squared (KÂ²) Test

The K-Squared test, also known as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, helps you assess whether a dataset follows a specific distribution. It's particularly useful when you want to check if your data fits a normal distribution.

## Shapiro-Wilk Test

The Shapiro-Wilk test is a goodness-of-fit test used to check if a dataset is normally distributed. It's a handy tool for ensuring that your data meets the assumptions of various statistical tests.

## Pearson Correlation Test

The Pearson Correlation test is used to measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It's a fundamental tool in understanding the association between variables.

## Spearman Rank Correlation Test

Sometimes, relationships between variables aren't linear. That's where the Spearman Rank Correlation test comes in handy. It assesses the strength and direction of monotonic relationships.
